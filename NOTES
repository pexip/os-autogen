1.  If you are reconfiguring this product, you _must_ use the config/
    bootstrap script.  The standard "configure" script is edited to
    produce a working script.

2.  If you have pulled the sources from GIT, there are a number of files
    that are required to build, but not part of the archive.  The needed
    sources are contained within a shar archive named "noag-boot.sh".
